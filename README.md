# OpenEO Tutorial for C-SCALE

This repository introduces the use of [openEO](https://openeo.cloud/) for C-SCALE. 

Two Jupyter Notebooks demonstrate the usage:
1. The *openEO_NDVItimeseriesAnalysis.ipynb* shows how to calculate synchonous jobs on the platform infrastructure. 
2. The *openeo_FORCE.ipynb* shows how to do an atmospheric correction of Sentinel 2 L1C images with [FORCE](https://force-eo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 

Please find the slides in this repository as [PDF](https://github.com/c-scale-community/c-scale-tutorial-openeo/blob/main/2022-12-14_openEO_Platform_Basic_Training_Intro.pdf).
The training has also been recorded and is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMiaBMh8VCQ).
